# AngularJS Berlin #8
## How to create a directive?

You'll find here the code used during my presentation to show how to quickly create a directive with AngularJS.

You'll find the directive's code in `/app/scripts/directives/menuFriends.coffee`

The service used to call Facebook and using $q (deferred/promise implementation) is in `/app/services/facebook.coffee`

The slides used during the presentation are here : [http://angrykatze.com/presentations/how-to-create-a-directive-with-angularjs/](http://angrykatze.com/presentations/how-to-create-a-directive-with-angularjs/).
